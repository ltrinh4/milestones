  <h1>Understanding HTML</h1>
  <p>We started learning to code last week. This is to test our ability to follow instructions and to review our comprehension over coding.</p>
  <p>I have come to the slow realization that I have no clue how to code. I really like cats. But I own birds. I won't be able to own a cat until my birds die. My cockatiels have a lifespan of like, 20 to 30 years. I'm going to have birds for such a long time, I might as well give up on a cat.</p>
<h2>Can Birds and Cats live in harmony?</h2>
<p>Well, I have seen a bunch of photos and videos of birds coexisting. They are quite adorable, actually. However, you'd have to teach a cat to not hunt, and most likely never have them in the same room.</p>
<p>Realistically, I'd want a larger bird that could defend itself to a cat. But the solution isn't to get more birds (or is it?). Realistically, I have two birds who could not stand a chance to cats. </p>
